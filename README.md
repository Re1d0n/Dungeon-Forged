# Dungeon-Forged

This is a collaboration project to create a Full-Stack single page application (SPA) using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node). Dungeon Forge is an application where users can generate and save their Dungeons and Dragons characters to their own personalized user account, as well as download their PDF character sheet for later.
